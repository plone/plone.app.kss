  [hannosch]

1.4.2 (2008-07-06)
------------------

- Make the plugin tolerant if jQuery is not present,
  and not have a "jq" reference error in this case.
  Previously any kss pages (for example, demos) that
  did not use jQuery, failed with a javascript error
  in the presense of this plugin.
  During this, most things seemed to be working,
  apart from any plugins that were missing because
  they were to be loaded after the error.

  runnable with a special branch of kss.demo,
  available from ploneout.

  [hannosch]

1.2-beta2 (2007-04-30)
----------------------

- Prepare for release
  [ree]

1.2-beta1.2 (2007-03-23)
------------------------

- Add monkeypatch to offer a temporary workaround to
  five.localsitemanager. This is actually not a kss issue,
  but the problem manifests when any other non-five site manager
  (like kss's one) is used together fith five's one. The
  result is, acquisition wrapping is not added in this case, and
  tools in Plone are returned without a parent. The current patch
  relocates the adding of the acquisition wrapping from the
  localsitemanager of five to the level of zope3. Thus acquisition
  will always be added.
  This is actually not a proper solution and is added from the wrong
  place at the moment.
  [ree]
