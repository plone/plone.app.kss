      [hannosch]

plone.app.kss - 1.4.2 Released 2008-07-06

    - Make the plugin tolerant if jQuery is not present,
      and not have a "jq" reference error in this case.
      Previously any kss pages (for example, demos) that 
      did not use jQuery, failed with a javascript error
      in the presense of this plugin.
      During this, most things seemed to be working, 
      apart from any plugins that were missing because 
      they were to be loaded after the error.

plone.app.kss - 1.2-rc1 Released 2007-07-08

    - Cleaned up Acquisition usage. self.context always needs to be unwrapped

      [hannosch]

plone.app.kss - 1.2-beta2 Released 2007-04-30

   - Prepare for release
     [ree]

plone.app.kss - 1.2-beta1.2 Released 2007-03-23

    - Add monkeypatch to offer a temporary workaround to
      five.localsitemanager. This is actually not a kss issue,
      but the problem manifests when any other non-five site manager
      (like kss's one) is used together fith five's one. The
      result is, acquisition wrapping is not added in this case, and
      tools in Plone are returned without a parent. The current patch
      relocates the adding of the acquisition wrapping from the
      localsitemanager of five to the level of zope3. Thus acquisition
      will always be added.
      This is actually not a proper solution and is added from the wrong
      place at the moment.
