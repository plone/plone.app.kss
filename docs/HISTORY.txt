    - Change workflow permissions to zope2.View, this almost matches
	  WorkflowTool.doActionFor which is declared public. Security checking is
	  performed explicitly inside DCWorkflow for transitions.
	  [ldr]
	
	- Make content tabs re-render on a workflow change. Workflows often change
	  the cmf.ModifyPortalContent permissions, making the edit tab inaccessible.

   - Prepare for release
     [ree]

plone.app.kss - 1.2-beta1.2 Released 2007-03-23

    - Add monkeypatch to offer a temporary workaround to
      five.localsitemanager. This is actually not a kss issue,
      but the problem manifests when any other non-five site manager
      (like kss's one) is used together fith five's one. The
      result is, acquisition wrapping is not added in this case, and
      tools in Plone are returned without a parent. The current patch
      relocates the adding of the acquisition wrapping from the
      localsitemanager of five to the level of zope3. Thus acquisition
      will always be added.
      This is actually not a proper solution and is added from the wrong
      place at the moment.
